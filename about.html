            The Taj Mahal Palace is a heritage, five-star, luxury hotel in the
            Colaba area of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, situated next to the
            Gateway of India. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, it opened in
            1903 as the Taj Mahal Hotel and has historically often been known
            simply as "The Taj". The hotel is named after the Taj Mahal, which
            is located in the city of Agra approximately 1,050 kilometres (650
            mi) from Mumbai. It has been considered one of the finest hotels in
            the East since the time of the British Raj. The hotel was one of the
            main sites targeted in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

          <h3>Creator of Taj</h3>
          <p>
            Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the Tata Group, opened the Taj
            Mahal Palace, a hotel in Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) overlooking
            the Arabian Sea, on 16 December 1903. It was the first Taj property
            and the first Taj hotel. There are several anecdotal stories about
            why Tata opened the Taj hotel.

          <h3>CEO of Taj</h3>
          <p>
            Puneet Chhatwal, MD & CEO of IHCL, that runs the Taj group of
            hotels, explains why it is important for hotels to be present across
            segments in India, his company's plans and more. A visit to the
            Presidential Suite at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai is an
            overwhelming experience. It is very large, luxurious and has had an
            impressive guest list.
