        <h2><span class="text-primary">The History</span> Of Our Hotel</h2>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal Hotel was commissioned by Jamsetji Tata and opened its
          doors to guests on 16 December 1903. An oft-repeated story concerning
          the reasoning behind the construction of the hotel was Tata being
          refused admission into Watson's Hotel, as it was reserved for
          Europeans.
